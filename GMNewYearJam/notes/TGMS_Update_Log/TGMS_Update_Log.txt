[Update Log]

Welcome, fellow log enthusiast!  

[!! Breaking Changes !!]
	
	#1  GameMaker 2022 or newer is required.
		If you need to revert to a previous version supporting pre-2022, you can download v1.12 from here: 
		https://stephenloney.com/_/TweenGMS/112/TweenGMS_Pro_v112.yymps

	#2	(As of v1.11) Please be aware that target handling for tween callbacks has been modified.
		Methods used as a callback script will now use the specified callback target, overriding its existing calling environment.
		To maintain a method's existing 'self', please use the keyword [undefined] as the callback target.
		You can find more information about this in the log below or under TweenAddCallback() in the Script Reference.
		If upgrading an existing project, please validate that your tween callbacks still work as intended.
